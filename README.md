# Numerical-Methods
## Capstone Project for Introduction to Numerical Methods in the second year of Computer Science studies.

The program is designed to solve the following tasks:

  ### **1. Approximations**
   
  **Task 1:**  
    Develop and run a computer application that calculates the relative and absolute errors after entering two numbers: the exact and the approximate values.
    
  **Task 2:**  
    Create and run a computer application that finds the exact value of a number given its approximate value and absolute error in two cases:  
      1.1 The number is underestimated.  
      1.2 The number is overestimated.  

  ### **2. Interpolations**

**Task 1:**  
Write and execute a computer application that, based on four pairs of values (x, f(x)) entered by the user, finds a third-degree interpolating polynomial approximating the function f(x). If this operation is impossible, the program should inform the user.

  ### **3. Approximation functions**

**Task 1:**  
Develop and run a computer application that, based on the data from the table below:  

i  | xi | yi  
1  | 2  | 2.5  
2  | 4  | 10  
3  | 6  | 32  
4  | 8  | 40  
5  | 10 | 60  

finds a linear approximating function.

**Task 2:**  
Create and run a computer application that, based on the given data:  
(0.955, 5.722), (1.38, 4.812), (1.854, 4.727), (2.093, 4.850), (2.674, 5.011), (3.006, 5.253), (3.255, 5.617), (3.940, 6.282), (4.060, 6.255)  
using the following base functions: 1/x, x, x^2, finds an approximating function.

  ### **4. Integration** 
  
**Task 1:**  
Write and execute a computer application that calculates the integral value of a polynomial W(x) of at least the third order defined on a specified interval [a, b] using three methods:  
4.1 Rectangle method,  
4.2 Trapezoidal method,  
4.3 Parabolic method,  
with a specified accuracy. Compare and analyze the obtained results and the efficiency of these methods (e.g., the number of iterations required to achieve the desired accuracy).

### **5. Differentiation**  

**Task 1:**  
Develop and run a computer application that takes at least four pairs of points (x, f(x)), then calculates:  
5.1 Progressive differences,  
5.2 Backward differences,  
5.3 Difference quotients  
between the corresponding pairs of points. If this operation is impossible, the program should inform the user.


The entire project is being developed in Windows Forms .NET using the C# programming language. I chose this language because I am learning it for future engineering work.
